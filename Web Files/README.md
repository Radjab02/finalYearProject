A JAVA IMPLEMENTATION OF ADDITIVE HOMOMORPHIC      ENCRYPTION SCHEME Description of FYP:  The project aimed to implement the Paillier's encryption scheme which supports additive homomorphic property. The homomorphic property works as follows: Given the public key and the ciphertext C1 =Enc(M1 ), C2=Enc(M2), one can compute C3=C1 +C2 and decrypt the plaintext as M3=M1 +M2, without knowing what is the value of M1 and M2.  The first phase of the project was to implement the Paillier encryption schemeÍ¾ the second phase of the project was to apply the Paillier encryption scheme in Electronic Voting system as a website.
